Version 2.5 is the final version.

- The Zuno is turned on.
- The Zumo is placed on a line.
- Button A is pressed to start the calibration. The calibration is done when the Zumo stops moving.
- When calibration is done, the Zumo can be taken away from the line.
- The Zumo is then placed some random location pointing towards the maze.
- Button B is pressed.
- It should solve the maze ;-)))
